# weave-arm
Script for building a [Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-net/) version for ARMv7 that can be used as a network provider for Kubernetes.

Weave Net `v1.8.1` is not supported on ARM, that's why this script exists.

Even though the code / script is written with the best of effort and knowledge, it should still be treated, and is a hack.
